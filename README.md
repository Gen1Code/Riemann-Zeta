# Riemann Zeta Custom Theory

A Custom Theory for the mobile game [Exponential Idle](https://conicgames.github.io/exponentialidle/), the API and samples that helped create this come from [here](https://github.com/conicgames/theory-sdk)
To see the theory in game enter this link after pressing the '+' icon in the Custom Theory tab: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gen1Code/Riemann-Zeta/main/RZ.js

The CT is based on the [Riemann Zeta function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_zeta_function), this was the initial template created by myself, which another dev (propfeds) used to create the [current theory](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/propfeds/riemann-zeta/main/theory.js)
